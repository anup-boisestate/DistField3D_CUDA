# DistField3d_CUDA

Calculates in parallel using CUDA, the distance field for an interface
in a given VTI file using the Fast Sweeping Method.
The algorithm implemented for parallel fast sweeping
method is from a paper in the Journal of Computational Physics
titled "A parallel fast sweeping method for the Eikonal equation"
by Miles Detrixhe, Federic Gibou, and Chohong Min.
